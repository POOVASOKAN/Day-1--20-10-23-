Write a blog on Difference between HTTP11 vs HTTP2
HTTP stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it serves as the communication channel between client & Server. By using HTTP user sends 
the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
A)Multiplexing:
HTTP/1.1: Browsers would often open multiple TCP connections to the same server to download resources in parallel, as only one request 
can be active at a time per connection.
HTTP/2: Allows multiple requests and responses to be multiplexed over a single TCP connection, reducing the overhead of setting up multiple connections.

B) Stream Prioritization:
HTTP/1.1: No built-in mechanism to prioritize requests.
HTTP/2: Allows requests to be prioritized, which means that more important resources (like stylesheets) can be sent before less critical resources (like images).

C) Binary Framing layer Protocol:
HTTP/1.1: Text-based protocol, making it easier to read by humans but less efficient for machines.
HTTP/2: HTTP/2 breaks down communication into smaller binary-encoded messages, which is more efficient for parsing and reduces the chance of errors.

D) Server Push:
HTTP/1.1: Doesn't support this feature.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
HTTP/2: Allows servers to push resources proactively to the client's cache, potentially speeding up the loading of web pages by sending necessary assets before the client 
even knows it needs them.

E)Header Compression:
HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent as plain text, which can add a lot of overhead to requests, especially when cookies or other data are involved.
HTTP/2: Uses HPACK compression for headers, reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent for each request and response.

F)Data Frames:
HTTP/1.1: Data is transmitted as a whole, without a specific framing structure.
HTTP/2: Data is sent in smaller, discrete frames. This modular approach aids in multiplexing and stream prioritization.

G)Connection Efficiency:
HTTP/1.1: Typically utilizes multiple connections for concurrent tasks, resulting in slower performance.
HTTP/2: Streamlines communication by using a single TCP connection for multiple streams, maximizing efficiency, minimizing overhead, and enhancing short data transfer speeds.

H)Encryption:
HTTP/1.1: Supports both encrypted (HTTPS) and unencrypted (HTTP) traffic.
HTTP/2: While the standard doesn't mandate encryption, in practice, almost all HTTP/2 traffic is over HTTPS due to browser support policies. This requirement has 
contributed to a more secure web.
